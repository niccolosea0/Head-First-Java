/* 
    Exercise: Code Magnets

    A working Java program is scrambled up on the fridge. Can you reconstruct
    all the code snippets to make a working Java program that produces the
    output listed below? Some of the curly braces fell on the floor and they
    were too small to pick up, so feel free to add as many of those as you need!
